  ## A comprehensive study utilizing **Persistent Scatterer Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (PS-InSAR), satellite altimetry, and **tide gauge** data to analyze coastal subsidence and **regional sea level dynamics.
</div>

## 🧐 Overview & Objectives

1.  **Quantifying Ground Deformation:** Precisely measure millimeter-scale vertical ground motion using advanced PSInSAR techniques.
2.  **Analyzing Sea Level Trends:** Determine regional sea level trends using long-term tide gauge records and satellite altimetry data.
3.  **Causative factors:** Analyze the influence of **Land Use and Land Cover (LULC) changes** (e.g., urbanization) and underlying **lithological factors** on observed subsidence patterns.

## Data used

### 1. **Line of Sight Velocity / Ground subsidence (mm/ year)**

* **Technique:** **Persistent Scatterer Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (PS-InSAR)**.
* **Data Source:** **251 images** of Sentinel-1A/B (C-Band SAR), downloaded from the **Alaska Satellite Facility (ASF) Vertex**. 

### 2. **Regional Sea Level Dynamics**

* **Data Sources:**
    * **Satellite Altimetry:** From copernicus marine.
    * **Tide Gauge Records:** Tide Gauge Station at Kochi.

### 3. **Environmental Context**

* **LULC Change Detection:** Used to understand the spatial and temporal trends in **urbanization**. Utilized Landsat Imagery.
* **Lithological Influence:** The relationship between Lithology, LULC and subsidence were analyzed using **Geospatial Overlay analysis** in ArcGIS.
