## 🧐 Overview & Objectives

This project integrates advanced geospatial techniques to quantify and contextualize relative sea level change in coastal areas. The primary objectives are:

1.  **Quantifying Ground Deformation:** Precisely measure millimeter-scale vertical ground motion using advanced PSInSAR techniques.
2.  **Analyzing Sea Level Trends:** Determine regional sea level trends using long-term tide gauge records and satellite altimetry data.
3.  **Causative factors:** Analyze the influence of **Land Use and Land Cover (LULC) changes** (e.g., urbanization) and underlying **lithological factors** on observed subsidence patterns.

## 🛰️ Methodology & Data

### 1. **Line of Sight Velocity / Ground subsidence (mm/ year)**

* **Technique:** **Persistent Scatterer Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (PS-InSAR)**.
* **Data Source:** **251 images** of Sentinel-1A/B (C-Band SAR), downloaded from the **Alaska Satellite Facility (ASF) Vertex**.

### 2. **Sea Level Dynamics**

* **Data Sources:**
    * **Satellite Altimetry:** Used for regional sea surface height and sea level trend analysis.
    * **Tide Gauge Records:** Provides high-temporal-resolution local sea level data.

### 3. **Environmental Context**

* **LULC Change Detection:** Used to understand the spatial and temporal impact of **urbanization** and other land surface changes on ground stability.
* **Lithological Influence:** The relationship between rock/soil type and subsidence is analyzed using **Geospatial Overlay analysis** with geological maps.
